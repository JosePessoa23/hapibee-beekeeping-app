## Features

The following list of features were developed:  

- **US1** – As a beekeeper, I want to submit the annual declaration of hive stocks.  
- **US2** – As a beekeeper, I want to request transhumance.  
- **US3** – As a beekeeper, I want to create an apiary, submit the respective installation request, and register its constitution/information.  
- **US4** – As a beekeeper, I want to perform an apiary inspection and record it.  
- **US5** – As a beekeeper, I want to perform a hive division and record it.

## Priorities

The features were analyzed and divided into three priority groups:  

- **Very High Priority:**  
  - US3 — fundamental for the system, since the other functionalities depend on it.  
- **High Priority:**  
  - US2, US4, US5 — important because they represent the beekeeper’s daily activities.  
- **Medium Priority:**  
  - US1 — less essential for daily activities, since there are other ways to perform the annual declaration, which only occurs once a year.
